# major Requirements
1. Node js 
2. express

# How things are working
=> the request is going to the server and server is giving us response, for all this work we have a module i.e. express.
=> the server is listening the requests made by computer/mobile. '/' is the home route of any application. ALl this will be possible because of express package. 
=> There are various type of requests which come to the server. a. get b. post c. put d. delete

# Steps to create server
1. empty node app (npm init)
2. we will writing a script in our package.json file. in script tag we will write "start":"node index.js", we are writing this because, we will type "npm run start" and code will be execute and out backend will be started. 
3. installing express => npm i express (this will add it in our dependecies)
4. importing via two methods a. common js b. module js (ecma script), this is just a method to write i.e. old style or new style only. 

# Writing code in the file 
const express = require ("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000
app.get('/', (res, res)=>{
    res.send("This is our first app")
})
app.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log("listening to our port 3000")
})

//we can aslo hold many requests in like this by using this code

app.get('/login', (req, res)=>{
    res.send("Welcome to Login page..!!")
})

//our whole api reference of express depends on request and response. and you can send so many type of response from it. 
//here this is the server as this is not closing and listening continously. In it the changes will not be shown as soon as you change the code because the code after processing has already been sent to the server, and if you want to populate changes then you have to close the server and restart it again (to avaoid these you have various libraries ) like nodemon. 

# Making our code production ready..
=> As our code can contain various secret informations like port number and db user id and password, for this we have to use dotenv package,    .env
=> installing it => npm i dotenv
=> making a file => making file of name => .env and writing code inside it.

const express = require('express')
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const app = express();
dotenv.config()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
    res.send('This is our final app')
})
app.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log('server running on port ${port}')
})

in .env file, we will write
PORT = 3000
